            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/testimage.jpg" alt="Jon" width="170" height="170"> My name is Jon and I am an
            Arizona native. Even though I grew up living in Arizona, my summers were usually spent visiting my
            Grandparents in Iowa. During those trips I would get to see the United States in a way that only Grandma and
            Grandpa could show a person. We would often load up the Suburban and the travel trailer and hit the road.
            Sometimes going as far as Southern Iowa while other times travelling across the county seeing National
            Parks, State Capitols and other noteworthy locations. <br> <br> During the rest of the year, I was in
            Arizona and my Father would make sure I stayed busy and experienced "my best life." On the Weekends I would
            go camping either with my Father or with the Boy Scouts of America and over the course of my teen years I
            achieved the rank of Eagle Boy Scout with three palms. The Scouts provided me the opportunity to travel
            across Europe one year, and to New Zealand the next. Did you know that Astronaut Neil Armstrong and
            President Gerald Ford were both Eagle Scouts? As were 10 United States Senators and 17 members of the U.S.
            House of Representatives (2018). That's pretty good company to me!!

            <p style="clear:left">I have known my wife Laurie for 11 years where we first met Online. At the time I was
                extremely hesitant to start my dating profile but when she 'winked back' at me little did I know that my
                life would be changed forever (and for the better!!). We married in 2011 and we just welcomed our first
                child in 2018. Between work, school, and 'Daddy Duty' I am keeping quite busy in 2019!!</p>
            <p style="clear:left">Professionally, I joined the tech sphere in 2012 where I started learning about
                hosting, web design and web security. Presently, I work in the Information Security Division at GoDaddy
                as a PKI Associate. I joined this Bootcamp in an effort to broaden my technology portfolio as a Full
                Stack Web Developer.</p>
